# SVG grammar parser

uses PEG grammar file, returns all paths in the SVG

'npm run build' defined in package.json serves the webpack bundle and
to be able to run it in the browser, it requires an additional webpack config file.

In order to run it using the node dev tools (node-debug + Chrome/Chromium/Opera installed):
'npm start'

Else, simply call 'node src/index.js'
